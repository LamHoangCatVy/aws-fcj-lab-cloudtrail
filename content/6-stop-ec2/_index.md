1. Remember you have a secondary IAM user (dude-from-nowhere) that has the permissions to fully interact with Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3. Let's log in as the new dude-from-nowhere user by using the sign-in URL.

3. Navigate to EC2 service, and stop the instance as the following steps.
- In the `dude-from-nowhere` account, you'be issued some API calls by navigating through the AWS Management Console. All your actions are captured by CloudTrail.

- While you are logged in to the console as `dude-from-nowhere`, shut down an EC2 instance. Before you shut down any EC2 instances, make sure that you donâ€™t need them, or that you created an additional EC2 instance specifically for this exercise.

Log out as dude-from-nowhere and log back in as the administrator because you will next use Amazon Athena to query CloudTrail data!
