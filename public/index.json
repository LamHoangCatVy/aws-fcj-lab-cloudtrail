	"content": "Building a Simple AWS CloudTrail Data Analytics Solution Overview The demo will show how you can visualize AWS CloudTrail data in Amazon QuickSight and start building simple security dashboards. Although CloudTrail is enabled by default in every AWS Account, Kathy (me) will configure a new trail, and also to show where CloudTrail configurations are made.\nAfter configuring a new trail, I will add a new user into my AWS account (named dude-from-nowhere). I will then log in as that user and do some activity that simulates a user who is issuing application programming interface (API) calls. One of these API calls will (accidentally) turn off a web server. If you want to follow the exact instructions in your account, you can mimic the scenario that I has in this account before you enable CloudTrail. To do so, you can create an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance to function as the web server.\nAfter I turns off the web server as the user dude-from-nowhere, I will log out and log in again as an administrator. I will then use CloudTrail data to investigate what happened by getting information, such as when the server was turned off. I will also discover the other API calls that the nicholas user made, because that account could have been compromised.\nHere is the reference architect for this lab Content Configuring CloudTrail Add a secondary IAM User Create EC2 Instance Using dude-from-nowhere to Stop Instance Query CloudTrail data in Amazon Athena Visualizing Athena data in QuickSight Resources Clean Up "

Now, you will use CloudTrail data to investigate what happened and get evidence of the action, including:\nWho shut down the web server When they shut it down Where they shut it down from You will do this investigation by creating an Athena table that points to the S3 bucket that is used by your new CloudTrail configuration. As an AWS administrator: In the AWS Management Console, open the list of all AWS services by choosing Services, and locate and choose CloudTrail. In the navigation pane, choose Event history, and then choose Create Athena table In Storage location, choose the bucket you created as part of CloudTrail configuration. This action will update the structured query language (SQL) command that creates the table to use the corresponding bucket location\nChoose Create table You now have an Athena table with the same schema that is used by CloudTrail. The table points to the recently created S3 bucket that is used by CloudTrail.\nAs an AWS administrator: In the AWS Management Console, open the list of all AWS services by choosing Services, and locate and choose Athena. If this is the first time you’re using Athena in this AWS account, you will need configure some settings. In the upper-right area of the window, choose Settings. Then, select another S3 bucket for the Athena query result location by choosing the Select button. A bucket might have been automatically created for this purpose, so you might only need to select a bucket with a name that starts with aws-athena-query-results, click Choose After you select the bucket, choose Save, and you are ready to do Athena queries. To get the activity history of a given EC2 instance, run the following query. Make sure to replace the instance ID with your instance ID. You also need to replace YOUR-ATHENA-TABLE-HERE with the name of your Athena table. You can copy the table name from the navigation pane. The query looks like this example:\nSELECT * FROM YOUR-ATHENA-TABLE-HERE WHERE eventname LIKE \u0026#39;StopInstances\u0026#39; AND useridentity.username LIKE \u0026#39;dude-from-nowhere\u0026#39; Click Run.
